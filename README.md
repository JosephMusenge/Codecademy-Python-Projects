# Codecademy Python Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains projects completed as part of Codecademy's Learn Python 3 course. A total of eight (8) projects were undertaken, providing valuable hands-on experience in Python programming. These projects not only reinforced the understanding of Python as a programming language but also solidified the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Project Backgrounds and Questions

### 1. Physics Functions

As a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester, you'll find a set of functions in this project that will help your students calculate fundamental physical properties efficiently.

### 2. Scrabble Algorithm

In this project, data from a group of friends playing Scrabble is processed. Dictionaries are used to organize players, words, and their corresponding points.

### 3. Thread Shed

At the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed, you've been hired as a cashier. Your daily responsibilities involve tallying sales, calculating total revenue, and keeping track of customer names.
