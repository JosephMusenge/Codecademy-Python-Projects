# Codecademy Python Projects

# Introduction

These projects were completed as part of Codecademy's learn Python 3 course. I completed a total of eight (8) during this course. 
These six projects help to better understand Python as programming language, but also helped to cement the concepts learnt from the course.

# Project Backgrounds and Questions

1. # Physics Functions

You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

2. # Scrabble Algorithm

In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and point

3. # Thread Shed

You’ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed.  Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.
Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.
All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. 
Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.

4. # Hacking the Fender

The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. 
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender‘s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

5. # Carly's Clippers

You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. 
You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.

6. # Basta Fazoolin'

You’ve started a position as the lead programmer for the family-style Italian restaurant Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart. 
The restaurant has been doing fantastically and seen a lot of growth lately. You’ve been hired to keep things organized.
