# QUESTION: The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. 
# Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.

# Import all necessary modules
import csv
import json

compromised_users = []

with open('passwords.csv') as password_file:
  password_csv = csv.DictReader(password_file)
  for password_row in password_csv:
    #print(password_row['Username'])
    compromised_users.append(password_row['Username'])
#print(compromised_users)

with open('compromised_users.txt', 'w') as compromised_user_file:
  for compromised_user in compromised_users:
    compromised_user_file.write(compromised_user)

with open('boss_message.json', 'w') as boss_message:
  boss_message_dict = {
    "recipient": "The Boss",
    "message": "Mission Success"
  }
  json.dump(boss_message_dict, boss_message)

with open('new_passwords.csv', 'w') as new_passwords_obj:
  slash_null_sig = """U GOT SLASHED - SLASH NULL"""
  new_passwords_obj.write(slash_null_sig)

print(slash_null_sig)
